Samtools implements various utilities for post-processing alignments in the
SAM, BAM, and CRAM formats, including indexing, variant calling (in conjunction
with bcftools), and a simple alignment viewer.


Building samtools
=================

The typical simple case of building Samtools using the HTSlib bundled within
this Samtools release tarball and enabling useful plugins, is done as follows:

    cd .../samtools-1.3    # Within the unpacked release directory
    ./configure --enable-plugins --enable-libcurl --with-plugin-path=$PWD/htslib-1.3
    make all plugins-htslib

You may wish to copy the resulting samtools executable into somewhere on your
$PATH, or run it where it is.

Rather than running-in-place like that, the next simplest typical case is to
install samtools etc properly into a directory of your choosing.  Building for
installation using the HTSlib bundled within this Samtools release tarball,
also building the various HTSlib utilities such as bgzip and enabling useful
plugins, is done as follows:

    cd .../samtools-1.3    # Within the unpacked release directory
    ./configure --enable-plugins --enable-libcurl --prefix=/path/to/location
    make all all-htslib
    make install install-htslib

You will likely wish to add /path/to/location/bin to your $PATH.

See INSTALL for full building and installation instructions and details.


Using an optimised zlib library
===============================

Samtools has been minimally tested against both the Intel-optimised and
CloudFlare-optimised zlibs and shown to work.

They can be downloaded from:

    https://github.com/jtkukunas/zlib     # Intel
    https://github.com/cloudflare/zlib    # CloudFlare

Neither Samtools nor HTSlib needs recompiling to use these optimised libraries,
but the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable should be set to a directory
containing the libz.so.1 file.

Benchmarks comparing the various zlibs are available at:

    http://www.htslib.org/benchmarks/zlib.html

It is recommended that you perform your own rigorous tests for an entire
pipeline if you wish to switch to one of the optimised zlib implementations.
